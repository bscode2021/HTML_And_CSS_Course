<body>
    <p class="normal">
        This text will wrap when it needs to. The default behavior of text on a webpage. Surely, this makes things more
        organized. Doesn't it?
    </p>

    <p class="onLineBreak">
        This text will wrap to the next line only when there is a line break. No line break yet, keep going and going
        for now. Ok, here


        comes one.
    </p>

    <p class="keepGoing">
        This text will not wrap to the next line. It will just keep going and going and going and going and going and
        going and going and going and going and going and going and going.
